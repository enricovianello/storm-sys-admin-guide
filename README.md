# StoRM System Administration Guide

<br/>

The _StoRM System Administration Guide_ is divided into two main sections: 
- *Installation*
- *Configuration*

<br/>

The _Installation_ section explains how to properly install or upgrade all the StoRM services. First of all, it lists all the necessary _prerequisites_ that the administrators have to satisfy before install StoRM services. Then it shows the commands to use to install the latest version of StoRM components.

The _Configuration_ section explains how to configure StoRM. This section is mainly divided into two chapters: _YAIM Configuration_ and _Advanced Configuration_. The YAIM configuration chapter shows a list of the available YAIM variables for each StoRM component. The Advanced Configuration chapter explains the specific configuration files for each StoRM component and gives details about logging.
